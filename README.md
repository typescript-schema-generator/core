# TypeScript Schema Generator

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

The [core package](packages/core/README.md) of this mono repository is responsible for rendering TypeScript types and therefore entire schemas.

## Development Prerequisites

-   Make sure you have the [Node.js runtime](https://nodejs.org) installed.
-   Make sure you are using Node.js version 18. A simple way to switch versions is with the npm package [n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n).

```bash
npm install --global n
```

```bash
sudo n 18
```
